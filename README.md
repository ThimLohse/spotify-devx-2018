# Zoocial - smack sourcing music for you
### A Spotify DevX 2018 Project
##### Creators: *Thim Lohse*, *Kaylin Lee*, *Jesper Blomqvist*, *Quentin Lemaire* & *Li Ling*

Our group created an online hotspot where users from all over the world can connect temporarily and exchange music.
That's why we called it, Zoocial! Like in a Zoo where you can see animals from all around the world in one place, Zoocial let's you experience music preferences from people all around the globe in one place.

A simple click of a button, and our application generates a playlist with randomly choosen top songs from all the users connected, filters away duplicates, doing some shuffling magic and adding some new recommendations based on the collective preferences. Finally it adds the playlist automatically to your spotify account, and as icing on the cake: of course it has a ridiculous name!

Enjoy!
